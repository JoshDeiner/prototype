You're frustrated because your computer keeps freezing, especially when you try to use video editing software and when browsing with multiple tabs open.

Especially when I'm trying to edit videos, which is kind of important for my work, or even just when I have a few tabs open in Chrome. It's a relatively new machine, so it shouldn't be doing this! I'm getting really frustrated; can you please help me figure out what's going on?\n"
