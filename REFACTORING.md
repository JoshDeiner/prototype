# Voice Assistant Refactoring

This document outlines the refactoring of the prototype system into a modular monolith architecture.

## Overview of Changes

The original prototype code was refactored into a more modular structure while maintaining the core functionality. The new architecture follows a modular monolith pattern with clear separation of concerns and improved maintainability.

## Key Architecture Improvements

1. **Clear Module Boundaries**: Code is organized into cohesive modules with well-defined responsibilities
2. **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each module has a specific role in the system
3. **Dependency Isolation**: Reduces coupling between components 
4. **Improved Testability**: Modules can be tested in isolation
5. **Configuration Centralization**: All constants and settings moved to a central config file

## Directory Structure

The new structure follows this organization:

```
voice-assistant/
│
├── main.py                   # Starts app, routes user input
├── config.py                 # Constants, scene templates, paths
│
├── controller/               # Wrapper state machine
│   └── wrapper.py            # Core class controlling LLM ↔ OS flow
│

│   ├── llm_mode.py           # LLM handling, response parsing, validation

│   ├── validator.py          # Safety checks for commands/actions
│   └── file_utils.py         # Helpers like checking file paths
│
├── tests/
│   ├── test_wrapper.py       # (Placeholder for future tests)
│   └── test_prompt_generation.py
│
└── scenes/                   # (Uses existing scenes directory)
```

## Module Responsibilities

### Controller Layer
- **wrapper.py**: Implements the core state machine that manages transitions between LLM and OS modes

### Mode Controllers
- **llm_mode.py**: Handles all LLM interactions, prompt generation, response parsing
- **os_mode.py**: Manages OS command execution with safety checks

### LLM Service
- **local_llm.py**: Provides a unified interface to multiple LLM providers with fallbacks

### Prompt Management
- **prompt_builder.py**: Constructs prompts based on context, conversation history, and scenes
- **scene_loader.py**: Loads and validates scene definitions from files

### Utility Tools 
- **logger.py**: Centralized logging configuration
- **validator.py**: Action validation and safety checks
- **file_utils.py**: Common file operation helpers

### Configuration
- **config.py**: Central configuration with constants, templates, and paths

## Key Improvements by Category

### Code Organization
- Separated file operations from LLM processing
- Extracted validation logic into a dedicated validator
- Centralized configuration in a single file

### Interface Clarity
- Clear boundaries between modules
- Consistent method signatures
- Well-documented public interfaces

### Error Handling
- Improved error logging
- Better failure recovery
- Clearer error messages

### Testability
- Components can be tested in isolation
- Reduced dependencies between modules
- More mockable interfaces

## Migration Path

The new structure is designed to coexist with the existing codebase. The main components can be migrated gradually:

1. Start with new entry points that use the modular architecture
2. Switch components one at a time
3. Keep backward compatibility with existing scripts
4. Phase out old components as new ones are proven stable

## Next Steps

1. Add comprehensive unit tests for each module
2. Create integration tests for module interactions
3. Expand documentation for each component
4. Add more robust error handling throughout
